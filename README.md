# Auto Clear Cache
A web extension that automatically clears your browsing data on a regular basis.


## What is this for?
I've become very privacy-conscious in recent years, and because of that, I like to minimize my online fingerprint by clearing my browser data fairly often. To simplify that process, most browsers have an option to automatically clear your data the second you hit the close button. While this is pretty effective, I've also found it to be incredibly annoying for daily use. Clearing cache and cookies like this also means you typically have to sign into all your online accounts all over again, and if you're like me trying to have decent security on those accounts with MFA and such, that can be a huge drag at the start of the day.

With that in mind, I'm developing this fairly simple web extension as a sort of compromise between "clearing cache on close" and "not clearing cache at all unless you explicitly go out of your way to do it manually".
